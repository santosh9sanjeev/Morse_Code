# Morse_Code
A simple python Morse Code program
This project is a simple Python program explaining the working of Morse Code using a buzzer or LED in a RaspberryPi. In future I will upgrade this into a voice assistant such that, speech is taken into a string and will be converted to Morse Code which will be a fun way to learn Morse Code through coding.
